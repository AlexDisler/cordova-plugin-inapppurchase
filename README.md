A lightweight Cordova plugin for in app purchases on iOS/Android. See [demo app](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-inapppurchases-app) and [blog post](https://alexdisler.com/2016/02/29/in-app-purchases-ionic-cordova/).

## Looking for maintainers

If you would like to maintain this project, get in touch.

## Features

- Simple, promise-based API
- Support for consumable/non-consumable products and paid/free subscriptions
- Support for restoring purchases
- Uses well tested native libraries internally - [RMStore](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore) for iOS and an adjusted  [com.google.payments](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/cordova-plugin-google-payments/tree/master/src/android) for Android

## Install

    $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-inapppurchase

## Configuration

### iOS

No configuration is necessary.

### Android

You must create a ```manifest.json``` in your project's ```www``` folder with your Android Billing Key:

    { "play_store_key": "<Base64-encoded public key from the Google Play Store>" }

You can get this key from the Google Play Store (under "Services & APIs") after uploading your app.

## API

All functions return a Promise.

### Get Products

#### inAppPurchase.getProducts(productIds)

- ___productIds___ - an array of product ids

Retrieves a list of full product data from Apple/Google. **This function must be called before making purchases.**

If successful, the promise resolves to an array of objects. Each object has the following attributes:

- ```productId``` - SKU / product bundle id (such as 'com.yourapp.prod1')
- ```title``` - short localized title
- ```description``` - long localized description
- ```price``` - localized price

___Example:___

```js
inAppPurchase
  .getProducts(['com.yourapp.prod1', 'com.yourapp.prod2', ...])
  .then(function (products) {
    console.log(products);
    /*
       [{ productId: 'com.yourapp.prod1', 'title': '...', description: '...', price: '...' }, ...]
    */
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

### Buy

#### inAppPurchase.buy(productId)

- ___productId___ - a string of the productId

If successful, the promise resolves to an object with the following attributes that you will need for the receipt validation:

- ```transactionId``` - The transaction/order id
- ```receipt``` - On ***iOS*** it will be the base64 string of the receipt, on ***Android*** it will be a string of a json with all the transaction details required for validation such as ```{"orderId":"...","packageName:"...","productId":"...","purchaseTime":"...", "purchaseState":"...","purchaseToken":"..."}```
- ```signature``` - On Android it can be used to [consume](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase#inapppurchaseconsumeproducttype-receipt-signature) a purchase. On iOS it will be an empty string.
- ```productType``` - On Android it can be used to [consume](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase#inapppurchaseconsumeproducttype-receipt-signature) a purchase. On iOS it will be an empty string.

***Receipt validation:*** - To [validate your receipt](https://alexdisler.com/2016/03/20/validating-cordova-in-app-purchases-on-ios-and-android-using-nodejs/), you will need the ```receipt``` and ```signature``` on Android and the ```receipt``` and ```transactionId``` on iOS.

___Example:___

```js
inAppPurchase
  .buy('com.yourapp.prod1')
  .then(function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    /*
      {
        transactionId: ...
        receipt: ...
        signature: ...
      }
    */
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

### Subscribe

#### inAppPurchase.subscribe(productId)

- ___productId___ - a string of the productId

This function behaves the same as [buy()](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase#buy) but with subscriptions.

### Consume

#### inAppPurchase.consume(productType, receipt, signature)

- ___productType___ - string
- ___receipt___ - string (containing a json)
- ___signature___ - string

All 3 parameters are returned by the [buy()](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase#buy) or [restorePurchases()](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase#inapppurchaserestorepurchases) functions.

Call this function after purchasing a "consumable" product to mark it as consumed.

___NOTE: This function is only relevant to Android purchases.___

On ***Android***, you must consume products that you want to let the user purchase multiple times. If you will not consume the product after a purchase, the next time you will attempt to purchase it you will get the error message:
```Unable to buy item / Item already owned```.

On ***iOS*** there is no need to "consume" a product. However, in order to make your code cross platform, it is recommended to call it for iOS consumable purchases as well.

___Example:___

```js
// first buy the product...
inAppPurchase
  .buy('com.yourapp.consumable_prod1')
  .then(function (data) {
    // ...then mark it as consumed:
    return inAppPurchase.consume(data.productType, data.receipt, data.signature);
  })
  .then(function () {
    console.log('product was successfully consumed!');
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

### Restore Purchases

#### inAppPurchase.restorePurchases()

If successful, the promise resolves to an array of objects with the following attributes:

- ```productId```
- ```state``` - the state of the product. On ***Android*** the statuses are: ```0 - ACTIVE, 1 - CANCELLED,  2 - REFUNDED```
- ```transactionId```
- ```date``` - timestamp of the purchase
- ```productType``` - On Android it can be used to [consume](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase#inapppurchaseconsumeproducttype-receipt-signature) a purchase. On iOS it will be an empty string.
- ```receipt``` - On Android it can be used to [consume](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase#inapppurchaseconsumeproducttype-receipt-signature) a purchase. On iOS it will be an empty string.
- ```signature``` - On Android it can be used to [consume](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase#inapppurchaseconsumeproducttype-receipt-signature) a purchase. On iOS it will be an empty string.

___Example:___

```js
inAppPurchase
  .restorePurchases()
  .then(function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    /*
      [{
        transactionId: ...
        productId: ...
        state: ...
        date: ...
      }]
    */
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

See [Differences Between Product Types](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/Products.html)

### Get Receipt

#### inAppPurchase.getReceipt()

On ***iOS***, you can get the receipt at any moment by calling the getReceipt() function. Note that on iOS the receipt can contain multiple transactions. If successful, the promise returned by this function will resolve to a string with the receipt.

On ***Android*** this function will always return an empty string since it's not needed for Android purchases.

___Example:___

```js
inAppPurchase
  .getReceipt()
  .then(function (receipt) {
    console.log(receipt);
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.log(err);
  });
```


### Get Receipt Bundle

#### inAppPurchase.getReceiptBundle()

On ***iOS***, you can get the receipt bundle at any moment by calling the getReceiptBundle() function. Note that on iOS the receipt can contain multiple transactions. If successful, the promise returned by this function will resolve to an object with the following attributes:

- ```appVersion``` - The app‚Äôs version number
- ```originalAppVersion``` - The version of the app that was originally purchased (In the sandbox environment, the value of this field is always ‚Äú1.0‚Äù)
- ```bundleIdentifier``` - The app‚Äôs bundle identifier
- ```inAppPurchases``` - an array containing all in-app purchase receipts 
   - The in-app purchase receipt for a **non-consumable product**, **auto-renewable subscription**, or **free subscription** remains in the receipt *indefinitely*.
   - The in-app purchase receipt for a **consumable product** or **non-renewing subscription** is *added* to the receipt when the purchase is made. It is kept in the receipt until your app finishes that transaction. After that point, it is *removed* from the receipt the next time the receipt is updated‚Äîfor example, when the user makes another purchase or if your app explicitly refreshes the receipt.

**in-app purchase receipts** contains an array of objects with the following attributes:

- ```transactionIdentifier``` - The transaction identifier of the item that was purchased.
- ```quantity``` - The number of items purchased.
- ```purchaseDate``` - The date and time that the item was purchased.
- ```productId``` - The product identifier of the item that was purchased.
- ```originalPurchaseDate``` - For a transaction that restores a previous transaction, the date of the original transaction.
- ```subscriptionExpirationDate``` - The expiration date for the subscription, expressed as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.
- ```originalTransactionIdentifier``` - For a transaction that restores a previous transaction, the transaction identifier of the original transaction. Otherwise, identical to the transaction identifier.
- ```cancellationDate``` - For a transaction that was canceled by Apple customer support, the time and date of the cancellation
- ```webOrderLineItemID``` - The primary key for identifying subscription purchases.

See Apple documentation: [App Receipt Fields](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html)


On ***Android*** this function will always return an empty string since it's not needed for Android purchases.

___Example:___

```js
inAppPurchase
  .getReceiptBundle()
  .then(function (receiptBundle) {
    console.log(receiptBundle);
    /*
      {
        "originalAppVersion": "1.0",
        "appVersion": "0.1.0",
        "inAppPurchases": [
          {
                "transactionIdentifier":"123412341234",
                "quantity":1,
                "purchaseDate":"2016-07-05T10:15:21Z",
                "productId":"com.mycompany.myapp.weekly.v1",
                "originalPurchaseDate":"2016-07-05T10:15:22Z",
                "subscriptionExpirationDate":"2016-07-05T10:18:21Z",
                "originalTransactionIdentifier":"123412341234",
                "webOrderLineItemID":-1497665198,
                "cancellationDate":null
          }
        ],
        "bundleIdentifier": "com.mycompany.myapp"
      }
    */
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

## Debugging

- Have you enabled In-App Purchases for your App ID?
- Have you checked Cleared for Sale for your product?
- Does your project‚Äôs .plist Bundle ID match your App ID?
- Have you generated and installed a new provisioning profile for the new App ID?
